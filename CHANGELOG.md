# [1.2.0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/compare/v1.1.2...v1.2.0) (2017-06-08)


### Features

* **styles:** automatically handle custom-styles and fix CSS mixin support ([#31](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/issues/31)) ([138da23](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/138da23)), closes [#29](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/issues/29)

`CustomStyleService` has been deprecated in favor of `PolymerDomSharedStyles` and will be removed in 2.0.0.

A warning will be given when using `CustomStyleService.updateCustomStyles()`. Remove it and import `PolymerModule.forRoot()` in your application's root module to enable the new automatic custom style handling.

# [1.1.0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0) (2017-05-04)


### Features

* **util:** add webcomponentsReady function to help bootstrap apps ([aa093a1](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/aa093a1))

webcomponentsjs 1.0.0-rc.11 added `window.WebComponents` to indicate whether or not polyfills are being loaded. To take advantage of this and reduce complexity, Origami provides `webcomponentsReady()`. Instead of adding listeners for WebComponentsReady, just bootstrap the app when the function resolves.

Before:
```ts
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

function bootstrap() {
  platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
}

if (window.webcomponentsReady) {
  bootstrap();
} else {
  window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', bootstrap);
}
```

After:
```ts
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { webcomponentsReady } from '@codebakery/origami';

webcomponentsReady().then(() => {
  platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
});
```

Make sure you update webcomponentsjs! Either explicitly install it, or remove `bower_components` and reinstall to get the latest version.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **events:** the [polymer] selector has changed to [emitChanges], and [polymer-template] selector has changed to [polymer] to better reflect their purposes. The @PolymerProperty decorator has also changed to @PolymerChanges



<a name="0.5.0"></a>
# [0.5.0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2017-04-13)

<a name="0.4.0"></a>
# [0.4.0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2017-04-12)


### Features

* **events:** listen and notify Angular of object and array mutations ([95dedf3](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/95dedf3)), closes [#9](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/issues/9)



<a name="0.3.0"></a>
# [0.3.0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2017-04-11)


### Bug Fixes

* **collections:** missing paper-icon selectors ([05949c9](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/05949c9))
* **collections:** missing paper-tab selector ([2f3f6a0](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/2f3f6a0))
* **events:** remove initial polymer property event ([fa69915](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/fa69915))


### Features

* **events:** PolymerProperty now works automatically with getters and setters ([6081552](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/6081552)), closes [#6](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/issues/6)
* **templates:** add input to polymer templates to call Angular methods ([79004ec](https://github.com/hotforfeature/origami/commit/79004ec))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **events:** This allows Angular to set intial property values, which is more natural for when the decorator is used. It does mean that undefined decorated properties may remain undefined even if their Polymer counterpart has a value. The solution is to always set an initial value in Angular for @PolymerProperty properties.
* **events:** PolymerProperty.unwrap() has been removed. Decorate setters with @PolymerProperty() instead of unwrapping the value.
